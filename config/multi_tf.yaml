# Multi-timeframe symbol configuration
# Maps symbols to their optimal timeframe based on Optuna real-cost results.
#
# Usage: Add symbols here after Optuna confirms positive EV with real costs.
# The bot will scan each symbol on its assigned timeframe.
#
# Symbols NOT listed here default to H1 (the existing scan loop).
# Format:
#   SYMBOL:
#     timeframe: M15 | M30 | H1 | H4
#     optuna_ev: <best EV from Optuna>    (for reference)
#     source: <which Optuna run>          (for traceability)

# 2026-02-18: AAPL removed (weak EV 0.000273, underperformer)
# JP225 moved to H4 (WFO validated: $23.5k, Sharpe 1.46)
